The Arduino code (EST_Arduino_Code.ino) is designed to read and process data from a pressure sensor and an airflow sensor connected to analog input pins. At startup, the calibrateSensors() function takes multiple readings from both sensors to calculate average baseline values, which are used as offsets to correct sensor drift or initial noise. During each loop iteration, the code reads raw analog values from the sensors, applies these calibration offsets, and then maps the adjusted values linearly to meaningful physical units: pressure in bars and airflow in liters per minute. The mapf() function performs this floating-point mapping based on predefined sensor ranges. The processed sensor readings are then printed via serial communication every half-second, providing real-time monitoring of the pressurization and release process. This setup facilitates accurate data collection essential for calculating the efficiency of the tank's air release during the experiment.
