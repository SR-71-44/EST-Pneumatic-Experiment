The Arduino code (EST_Arduino_Code.ino) is designed to read and process data from a pressure sensor and an airflow sensor connected to analog input pins. At startup, the calibrateSensors() function performs a calibration step by taking 50 readings from both sensors while the system is at zero pressure and flow, calculating average baseline values (offsets) to correct for sensor drift or bias. During each loop iteration, the code reads raw analog values from the sensors, applies these calibration offsets, and then maps the adjusted values linearly to meaningful physical units: pressure in bars and airflow in liters per minute. The mapf() function performs this floating-point mapping based on predefined sensor ranges. The processed sensor readings are then printed via serial communication in the format pressure,airflow, with a new reading sent every half-second, providing real-time monitoring of the tank’s pressurization and release process. This setup facilitates accurate data collection essential for calculating the efficiency of the tank's air release during the experiment.

The MATLAB (EST_MATLAB_Code.m) script is designed to collect, process, and analyze sensor data transmitted from an Arduino during the pressurization and decompression phases of the experiment. It first establishes a serial communication link with the Arduino to continuously read sensor values representing pressure and airflow, which are received in bars and liters per minute, respectively. The script converts these values into standard SI units—pressure in Pascals and airflow in cubic meters per second—and stores time-stamped data for further analysis. After data collection is stopped, the script calculates the system’s efficiency by estimating the input energy based on the initial tank pressure and the output energy by numerically integrating instantaneous power derived from pressure and airflow data. The calculated efficiency is then compared to a placeholder for theoretical efficiency. Finally, the script visualizes the sensor data over time, including error bars based on specified sensor uncertainties, and displays the efficiency results, providing a comprehensive overview of the experiment’s performance.
