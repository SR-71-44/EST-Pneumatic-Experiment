This project analyzes the efficiency of a compressed air tank system by measuring the energy released during decompression. Using a combination of Arduino-based sensors and MATLAB scripts, the system captures real-time data from a pressure and airflow sensor, processes the data, calculates the energy output, and compares it to theoretical expectations. The primary goal is to estimate how efficiently compressed air is converted into usable energy, accounting for losses during release. The workflow consists of four scripts: two for the Arduino to calibrate and collect sensor data, and two for MATLAB to record and analyze the collected information.

EST_Arduino_Calibration.ino

This Arduino script performs a one-time calibration of the pressure and airflow sensors connected to the system. When the script is uploaded and executed, it prompts the user to ensure the system is at zero pressure and zero flow conditions. Over 50 samples, it calculates average baseline ADC (analog-to-digital converter) values for both sensors, which are treated as offsets to correct future measurements for sensor drift and ambient noise. These offsets are printed to the serial monitor and are intended to be manually transferred to the main data collection script. This calibration step is essential for ensuring accurate physical measurements during the experiment.

EST_Arduino_Collection.ino

This script runs on the Arduino and is responsible for real-time data acquisition from the pressure and airflow sensors. It continuously reads analog inputs, subtracts the previously obtained calibration offsets, and maps the resulting ADC values to physical units: pressure in bar and airflow in liters per minute. The script sends this processed data over the serial port in a comma-separated format (pressure,airflow) at a rate of 10 samples per second. The resulting output is used as the live input to MATLAB for storage and later analysis. This script forms the core of the experimental data acquisition system.

EST_MATLAB_Collect.m

This MATLAB script connects to the Arduino over a specified serial port and records real-time sensor data streamed from the EST_Arduino_Collection.ino script. For a fixed duration, it parses each incoming line, converts pressure readings from bar to Pascals and airflow from liters per minute to cubic meters per second, and timestamps each sample using MATLAB’s internal clock. The script displays live data to the console and saves all recorded data: pressure, airflow, and time into a .mat file named sensor_data.mat. This file serves as the input for the next phase: data processing and efficiency evaluation. The script ensures accurate and reproducible data collection during each experimental run.

EST_MATLAB_Process.m

This script processes the recorded data from the sensor_data.mat file to estimate the system’s energy efficiency. It first filters out static or plateau data where no meaningful pressure or flow change occurs, improving the reliability of the calculation. The script then calculates the input energy stored in the tank based on the initial pressure and volume using thermodynamic equations, and computes the output energy by integrating the power output over time. Power is determined from the instantaneous product of pressure and airflow, adjusted with a logarithmic factor accounting for pressure drop. The calculated efficiency is displayed with its uncertainty, alongside the theoretical value, and two plots are generated: one showing pressure over time and the other showing airflow over time, both including error bars based on sensor uncertainty. This script delivers a comprehensive view of the system’s performance, making it the final analytical step in the project.
