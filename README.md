The Arduino code (EST_Arduino_Code.ino) is designed to read and process data from a pressure sensor and an airflow sensor connected to analog input pins. At startup, the calibrateSensors() function takes multiple readings from both sensors to calculate average baseline values, which are used as offsets to correct sensor drift or initial noise. During each loop iteration, the code reads raw analog values from the sensors, applies these calibration offsets, and then maps the adjusted values linearly to meaningful physical units: pressure in bars and airflow in liters per minute. The mapf() function performs this floating-point mapping based on predefined sensor ranges. The processed sensor readings are then printed via serial communication every half-second, providing real-time monitoring of the pressurization and release process. This setup facilitates accurate data collection essential for calculating the efficiency of the tank's air release during the experiment.

The MATLAB (EST_MATLAB_Code) script is designed to collect, process, and analyze sensor data transmitted from an Arduino during the pressurization and decompression phases of the experiment. It first establishes a serial communication link with the Arduino to continuously read raw sensor values representing pressure and airflow. These raw values are converted into meaningful physical quantities—pressure in Pascals and airflow in cubic meters per second—using calibration mappings. The script stores time-stamped sensor data in arrays for further analysis. After data collection is stopped, the script calculates the system’s efficiency by estimating the input energy based on the initial tank pressure and the output energy by numerically integrating instantaneous power derived from pressure and airflow data. The calculated efficiency is then compared to a theoretical efficiency placeholder. Finally, the script visualizes the sensor data over time, including error bars based on specified sensor uncertainties, and displays the efficiency results, providing a comprehensive overview of the experiment’s performance.
